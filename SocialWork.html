            <p id="Normal">The main objective of this project was for the the Data Science Research Lab to Collaberate with the Social Work Department at Morgan State to both 
            to analyze homelessness within different groups of people.
            </p>
            <p id="Normal">Social work plays a vital role in analyzing homelessness by addressing both individual needs and systemic factors that contribute to housing instability.
                 Social workers assess the diverse causes of homelessness, such as economic hardship, mental health issues, substance abuse, family dynamics, and social inequalities, to understand the challenges faced by affected individuals.
            </p>
            <p id="Normal">Data science can support social work by analyzing large sets of data to identify patterns, predict needs, and improve services for vulnerable populations. By using data from various sources, social workers can gain insights into issues like homelessness, mental health, and poverty, helping to allocate resources more effectively and tailor interventions.
                 This collaboration enables evidence-based decisions, making social services more responsive and impactful.
            </p>
            <p id="Normal">The outcome the team came up and the findings of their research was very productive and helpful to the cause. Using Data Science in this study with the help of social work really came to prove that these two fields should be in collberation 
                woth one another more often.
